    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    0. Definitions.

    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.

    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
    Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
    individuals or organizations.

    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
    fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
    copy. The resulting work is called an "unmodified version" of the original
    Program if it has been made by others acting under your authority.

    "Distribute" means to initiate or provide for, whether directly or
    indirectly, a means whereby copies of a program or the output of a program
    are supplied to a third party. Mere interaction with a user through a
    computer network, with no transfer of a copy, does not constitute
    distribution.

    An "interactive user interface" means an interactive user interface
    involving the use of a computer network or the output of a program via a
    computer network.

    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
    source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and to
    modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,
    it does not include production, installation, or distribution programs that
    are part of the normal operating system (if any) of the computer on which
    the work runs, unless that program itself is a derivative of the work.

    The Corresponding Source for a work means the work as a whole, so
    that all its parts are controlled by their respective licenses.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you must not
    invalidate the terms of any other license, whether specific to a part of
    the work or applicable to the work as a whole.

    1. Source Code.

    The Corresponding Source is the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. "Object code" means any form of a work that is not
    the Corresponding Source.

    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
    it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
    publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
    notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in
    accordance with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices
    of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this
    License along with the Program.

    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
    you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

    2. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
    of section 1, provided that you also take these actions:

        a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
        it, and giving a relevant date.

        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
        This requirement modifies the "keep intact all notices" requirement
        of section 1.

        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
        to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
        therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
        terms, to the whole work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
        are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work
        in any other way, but it does not invalidate any permission you
        might have separately received to use, modify, or distribute the
        work under other terms.

        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces that are controlled
        by computer network, the notice required by section 1 of this
        License must appear prominently in the initial view of the
        application.

        e) The work must include a copy of this License.

    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
    you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

    3. Object Code Conveyance.

    You may convey the object code form of a work under the terms of
    sections 1 and 2, provided that you also convey the
    Corresponding Source in one of these ways:

        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
        customarily used for software interchange.

        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
        written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third
        party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
        performing this conveying of source, a complete machine-readable
        copy of the Corresponding Source, which is to be delivered using
        a durable physical medium customarily used for software
        interchange.

        c) Convey the object code with an offer to give access to the
        Corresponding Source (other than a downloading service) from a
        network server at no charge, through any public access network
        protocol, for as long as the object code is available to
        the public.

        d) By offering access to the Corresponding Source from a network
        server at no charge, through any public access network protocol,
        for as long as the object code is available to the public. This
        offer is sufficient to satisfy the requirement to convey the
        Corresponding Source. If the location and the network protocol
        are known to the recipients of the object code, the Corresponding
        Source need not be included in the object code.

        e) Convey the object code by transmitting it over a network (including
        an interactive user interface), provided that the recipient
        receives a machine-readable copy of the Corresponding Source by
        downloading it through an appropriate network protocol
        within one month.

    A "user" of an interactive user interface includes anyone who has
    authorized a third party to use the interface on their behalf.

    If you convey object code in a modular system that is licensed under this
    License, the Corresponding Source need not include source code for other
    modules of the system that are not derivatives of the Program.

    4. Terminating the license.

    You may not propagate or modify the Program except as expressly provided
    under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify the
    Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
    License (including any patent licenses granted under the second paragraph
    of section 11).

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
    unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
    terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
    fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior
    to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
    permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
    some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
    of violation (for any form of the Program) from that copyright holder,
    and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
    notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.

    5. Acceptance.

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    run the Program. Independent propagation of a covered work without a
    license is prohibited.

    However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
    propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright
    if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating
    the Program, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

    6. Additional Permissions.

    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions or granting waivers as to all or part of
    the Program. Additional permissions that are permitted to be stated
    within this License are treated as additional terms, which may be
    added to the work at your discretion. If a work contains additional
    permissions or is a work licensed under a different license that allows
    additional permissions, those additional permissions may be added to
    the work at your discretion.

    7. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

    You may convert a covered work into any other form or format, provided
    that this does not modify or obscure the notices required by this
    License.

    8. Use over a Network.

    If you modify the Program or use it to provide a service that makes
    modified or unmodified copies of the Program or part of it available
    to third parties over a network, you must ensure that all such third
    parties can receive a copy of the Program's Corresponding Source,
    either through a separate distribution channel or via the network
    interaction. If you don't want to make the source code available to
    network users, you may not modify or use the Program in this manner.

    9. Termination.

    This License applies for the entire period of copyright on the Program.

    10. No Warranty.

    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
    WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    11. Limitation of Liability.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
    CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
    ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
    LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
    PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    12. General Provisions.

    If any part of this License is found to be invalid or unenforceable
    under applicable law, that part shall be enforced to the maximum
    extent possible, and the remainder of the License shall continue
    in full force and effect.

    13. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
    and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, whether written or
    oral.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
