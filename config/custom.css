/* ==========================================================================
   WAYPANEL USER CUSTOMIZATION (custom.css)
   ==========================================================================

   This file is the absolute highest priority in the CSS cascade. 
   Rules defined here will override themes, base plugin styles, and 
   the dynamically generated font/structural injections.

   HOW TO USE:
   1. To override a style, uncomment the relevant block.
   2. You can find all available CSS classes by extracting and inspecting 
      the .css files located in your Waypanel installation directory:
      ~/.../waypanel/resources/themes/css/ (or your plugin directories).
   3. Changes are detected automatically by the CSS Generator plugin.

   If you break the CSS syntax (e.g., forgetting a semicolon), 
   the GTK CSS engine will fail to parse this file and 
   revert to the generated styles.css defaults.
